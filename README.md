# ü§ñ Agentic AI Trip Planner - PlanMyTrip

This is a **next-generation agentic AI application** that autonomously generates personalized travel itineraries using intelligent AI agents. Unlike traditional applications, this system features an AI agent that can reason, adapt, and make decisions to create truly personalized travel experiences.

## üß† What Makes This Agentic?

- **Intelligent Decision Making**: The AI agent analyzes user preferences, destination characteristics, and travel constraints to make smart recommendations
- **Autonomous Planning**: The agent independently structures daily activities, optimizes routes, and balances different aspects of the trip
- **Contextual Understanding**: Uses advanced prompt engineering to understand nuanced travel preferences and adapt recommendations accordingly
- **Dynamic Personalization**: Each itinerary is uniquely crafted based on real-time analysis of user inputs and preferences
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: The agent can reason about travel logistics, timing, and user satisfaction to create optimal plans

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to generate personalized travel itineraries using an AI-powered agent. Users can register, log in, create travel plans with custom preferences for specific destinations, view their past trips, and download itineraries as PDF files.

## üß† AI Agent Architecture

The core of this application is an **intelligent AI agent** built with LangChain that demonstrates true agentic behavior:

### Agent Capabilities
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: The agent independently analyzes user inputs and makes intelligent decisions about itinerary structure
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Uses advanced prompt engineering to understand complex travel requirements and preferences
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adapts recommendations in real-time based on user feedback and changing requirements
- **Structured Output Generation**: Produces validated, structured JSON responses using Pydantic models
- **Multi-step Planning**: Breaks down complex travel planning into logical, sequential steps

### How the Agent Works
1. **Input Processing**: Receives user preferences, destination, and duration
2. **Context Analysis**: Analyzes travel themes, budget constraints, and group dynamics
3. **Intelligent Planning**: Creates optimized daily schedules with appropriate activities
4. **Validation**: Ensures output meets structured format requirements
5. **Personalization**: Tailors recommendations based on specific user preferences

### Agent vs Traditional Applications
Unlike traditional rule-based systems, this AI agent:
- **Thinks** about travel logistics and user satisfaction
- **Adapts** to different travel styles and preferences
- **Learns** from context to make better recommendations
- **Reasons** about timing, location, and activity compatibility
- **Creates** unique, personalized experiences for each user

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
gh repo clone Shubham281103/PlanMyTrip
cd <project-root-directory>
```

### 2. Start the Project with Docker
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```
This will start the Postgres database, backend (FastAPI), and frontend (React) containers.

### 3. Run Database Migrations (First Time or After Model Changes)
You must run Alembic migrations to create/update the database schema. This is required on any new environment (laptop, server, etc.).

```sh
docker-compose exec backend alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

- This will create all necessary tables in the database.
- If you change models in the backend, generate a new migration and upgrade again:
  ```sh
  docker-compose exec backend alembic -c alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"
  docker-compose exec backend alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
  ```

### 4. Access the App
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### 5. Default Database Credentials (from docker-compose.yml)
- **Database:** trip_planner
- **User:** trip_planner_user
- **Password:** password
- **Host:** localhost (for local connections)
- **Port:** 5432

---

## Notes
- Always run migrations after cloning or setting up on a new machine.
- If you reset the database, re-run the migrations to recreate tables.
- For development, you can remove the Postgres volume to reset the database:
  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  docker volume rm updated_trip_planner_postgres_data
  docker-compose up -d
  docker-compose exec backend alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
  ```

---

For any issues, check the backend and database logs, and ensure migrations are up to date.
